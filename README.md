# Onesixteen

## Description

A small virtual machine and assembler collection. It features a simplistic assembler and a 16-bit virtual machine with a load-store instruction set architecture. This collection was written in C and compiles with `gcc`. Onesixteen was started as an attempt to make and implement an assembler at last.
